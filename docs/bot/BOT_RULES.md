# Bot decision rules (Beljot, Bitola variant)

This document describes exactly how the bot decides, across every scenario, what it
considers, and with examples. It reflects the current logic including the latest tuning
(candidate-aware bidding, unbacked side-Ace and two-trump Jack+9 bids, partner trump-draw,
boss preservation, uncuttable-boss last-trick retention, Ace/Ten boss handling, suppressing
trump draws once the opponents are void of trump, leading into a partner's void, and smearing
onto a partner's boss).

Suit notation: ♠ spades, ♥ hearts, ♦ diamonds, ♣ clubs. Ranks: A, K, Q, J, T (ten), 9, 8, 7.

## 1. Where the logic lives

| Concern | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| All decision logic (pure, deterministic) | `server/internal/bot/bot.go` | Almost all tuning goes here |
| What the bot is allowed to know | `server/internal/bot/view.go` | Redacted, seat-local snapshot |
| What the bot remembers | `server/internal/bot/memory.go` | Played cards, voids, revealed declarations |
| Timing, humanization, scheduling | `server/internal/match/bot_driver.go` | Think delay, when the bot acts |
| Card point and strength tables | `server/internal/game/types.go` | Tables every heuristic reads |
| Legality (the rules cage) | `server/internal/game/validation.go` | The bot only ever chooses among legal cards |
| Tests for all of the below | `server/internal/bot/bot_test.go`, `simulation_test.go` | Table tests + heuristic-vs-random simulation |

`Decide(View) game.Action` is **pure and deterministic**: there is no randomness in card
choice. The only randomness is the think delay in the match layer. Every decision below is
fully reproducible and table-testable.

## 2. Card values and strength

```
TRUMP      points:    J=20  9=14  A=11  T=10  K=4  Q=3  8=0  7=0
TRUMP      strength:  J > 9 > A > T > K > Q > 8 > 7
NON-TRUMP  points:    A=11  T=10  K=4  Q=3  J=2  9=0  8=0  7=0
NON-TRUMP  strength:  A > T > K > Q > J > 9 > 8 > 7
```

Note: in the non-trump order the **Ten outranks the King** (T=6, K=5), which matters for the
follow-suit / must-overplay rules.

---

## 3. Top-level decision order (`Decide`)

Every time it is the bot's turn, it checks these in strict priority:

1. **Partner proposed surrender** -> always accept. The bot never initiates surrender and
   never responds to an opponent's proposal.
2. **Bidding phase** -> `decideBid` (Scenario A).
3. **Belote / Rebelote pending** (+20) -> always announce. Unconditional value.
4. **Awaiting declaration** -> always declare. The engine auto-detects melds; declaring
   always maximizes points.
5. **Otherwise** -> `chooseCard` (Scenario B).

Scenarios 1, 3, 4 are "always do it" with nothing to tune. The real intelligence is in
**bidding** and **card play**.

---

## 4. Scenario A: Bidding (choosing trump)

Bidding happens on the 5-card stage-1 hand. There are two rounds.

### 4.0 The revealed candidate card is counted

Whoever picks the trump **always receives the face-up candidate card** (the engine appends it
in `handlePickTrump`, both rounds). So the bot evaluates the hand it would actually hold after
picking: `hand + candidate` (built in `decideBid`).

- **Round 1**: the candidate is a trump (its suit is the trump suit), so it adds to the trump
  count. The 3-card rules now apply to **2 in hand + candidate**; the 4-card rule to
  **3 in hand + candidate**.
- **Round 2**: the candidate is a side card (its suit is locked out), so it can supply a
  side Ace for rules 4.3 / 4.4.

Example: hand J♥ 9♥, candidate A♥ -> 3 trumps (J, 9, A) -> take.
Example: hand J♥ + side A♣, candidate 9♥ -> 2 trumps (J, 9) + a side Ace -> take (rule 4.4).

### The hand-strength gate: `wantsTrump`

A single yes/no evaluator used in both rounds. For a given suit, the bot wants it as trump if:

- it holds **4 or more** cards of that suit -> yes (unconditional), or
- it holds **exactly 3** including the **Jack** with **neither a 7 nor an 8** among them (the
  other two trumps both 9 or higher); or exactly 3 including the **Jack** with a 7 or 8 among
  them **plus a side Ace** (the outside winner rescues the weaker holding), or
- it holds **exactly 3** with the **9 + Ace** pair, and also holds a **side Ace** (any Ace in
  another suit; it need not be backed by a second card of its suit), or
- it holds **exactly 2** trumps that are the **Jack and the 9** (the two strongest trumps),
  and also holds a **side Ace**, or
- otherwise: no.

#### 4.1 Four or more trumps -> unconditional take.

#### 4.2 Three trumps including the Jack (tightened, with a side-Ace rescue)

Take if the other two trumps are both 9 or higher. If a 7 **or** an 8 is among the three the
hand is weaker — but it **still calls when the hand holds a side Ace** (an Ace in another suit,
an outside winner). With a 7/8 and no side Ace, pass.

| 3 trumps (incl. candidate) | Side Ace? | Take? | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| J♥ 9♥ A♥ | — | yes | Jack, other two (9, A) are above 8 |
| J♥ K♥ Q♥ | — | yes | Jack, K and Q are above 8 |
| J♥ 9♥ 7♥ | no | no | contains a 7, no outside Ace |
| J♥ 8♥ K♥ | no | no | contains an 8, no outside Ace |
| J♥ 7♥ 8♥ | no | no | contains both 7 and 8, no outside Ace |
| J♥ 8♥ 7♥ + A♠ | yes | yes | weak three, but the side A♠ rescues it |

#### 4.3 Pair 9 + Ace with a side Ace

The 9 + Ace trump pair calls with any **side Ace** — an Ace in another suit. The Ace does
**not** need a second card of its suit to back it: a lone side Ace is enough. Logic:
`hasSideAce`.

| Hand (incl. candidate) | Take? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 9♥ A♥ Q♥ + A♣ T♣ | yes | pair 9+A, side A♣ |
| 9♥ A♥ Q♥ + A♣ K♦ | yes | a lone side A♣ is enough (no backing needed) |
| 9♥ A♥ Q♥ + K♣ K♦ | no | no side Ace at all |

#### 4.4 Two trumps: the Jack and the 9 with a side Ace

Exactly two trumps call **only** when they are the **Jack and the 9** — the two strongest
trumps (J=20, 9=14) — and the hand also holds a **side Ace**. Any other two-trump holding
passes. Logic: the `count == 2` branch in `wantsTrump` (`hasJack && hasNine && hasSideAce`).

| Hand (incl. candidate) | Take? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| J♥ 9♥ + A♣ | yes | the two strongest trumps, backed by a side Ace |
| J♥ 9♥ | no | no side Ace |
| J♥ A♥ + A♣ | no | two trumps but not the Jack **and** the 9 |
| J♥ T♥ + A♣ | no | the second trump is the Ten, not the 9 |

Note: this rule targets **exactly two** trumps; adding a third trump makes it a *three*-trump
hand judged by rule 4.2. With the side-Ace rescue in 4.2, the two rules now agree — J♥ 9♥ +
side Ace calls (4.4), and so does J♥ 9♥ 7♥ + side Ace (4.2). A Jack plus a side Ace is enough
whether the hand holds two or three trumps.

### Round 1 (`decideBid`)

Only one option: the candidate's suit. The bot calls
`wantsTrump(hand + candidate, candidate.Suit)` and picks or passes.

### Round 2

If all four passed in round 1, the candidate's suit is locked out. The bot evaluates **every
other suit** with the same gate, and among those that pass, picks the **highest-scoring** one
via `trumpSuitScore`:

```
score(suit) = sum over cards of that suit of ( trumpPoints[rank] + 10 )
```

The per-card `trumpLengthBonus` (currently 10) biases toward a longer suit over raw points.

### Bidding tuning levers

- The whole `wantsTrump` threshold logic: the biggest dial for aggressive vs. conservative.
  It currently considers no partner, score, or dealer position.
- `trumpLengthBonus` (currently 10): raise to favor length, lower to favor points.
- There is no forced pick in round 2: if no suit qualifies, all pass and the deck reshuffles.

## 5. Scenario B: Card play

Entry: `chooseCard`. Decision tree:

```
1. Only one legal card?            -> play it (forced).
2. Endgame retention (dix de der)? -> retainLastTrickWinner (hold a guaranteed trick-8 winner
   for +10).
3. Trick is empty (leading)?       -> chooseLead.
4. Trick in progress (following)?  -> chooseFollow.
```

Everything operates only on the legal-card set. The bot never reasons about legality: the
engine already filtered (follow suit, must-overplay / iber, must-cut, over-trump).

### B1. Endgame retention "dix de der" (+10)

Fires only at the second-to-last trick (exactly 2 cards in hand). The forced 8th trick goes to
whoever retains the best card; its winner gets +10. The bot must hold the **master trump**
(no opponent can beat it) — a guaranteed trick-8 winner under **any** lead: it wins whether led
or forced in as a follow. It normally spends its other card now and banks the master for trick 8.

Defers (back to normal heuristics) unless all hold: exactly 2 cards left; the bot's best trump
is the master; the card it would spend is legal this trick; and the partner is not already known
to hold a higher trump (do not fight the partner).

Example: trump ♠, hand J♠ + 7♥, all other trumps gone -> play 7♥ now, keep J♠ for trick 8.

**Generalization — an uncuttable non-trump boss is also a guaranteed trick-8 winner**
(`isUncuttableBoss`): a non-trump card that is the boss of its suit **and** cannot be ruffed
(the opponents are out of trump, so no one can cut it — `opponentsOutOfTrump`). Such a card wins
trick 8 **only when the bot leads trick 8**. So when the bot holds the master trump **plus** an
uncuttable boss, both cards win the last trick, and the bot spends the **master trump first**
(leading the trump wins trick 7 and hands the bot the lead into trick 8, where the boss then
wins) and keeps the boss for last. The outcome is identical to keeping the master, but the trump
is led first and the side winner is held in reserve.

Example: trump ♠, hand J♠ + A♥, opponents out of trump -> lead J♠ now (win trick 7), keep A♥ for
trick 8 (it wins uncut). Previously the bot led A♥ first and kept J♠.

**Why the non-master case is *not* re-ordered**: if the bot holds a *lower* trump plus an
uncuttable boss, spending that trump first would only hand the lead — and the master trump — to
the partner, who then leads an unknown card into trick 8. Cashing the boss now is at least as
good: the partner still controls trick 8 either way, so the +10 stays with the team. Only the
master-trump holder gains from re-ordering. This case therefore defers, exactly as before.

### B2. Leading a trick (`chooseLead`)

In priority order:

1. **Draw trumps with the master**: lead the highest trump, but only if all four hold: my
   team called trump, trumps still sit with opponents, **I still hold the master trump**, and
   the **opponents are not already out of trump** (`opponentsOutOfTrump`) — see the note below.

2. **Draw trumps for the partner** (`partnerDrawTrump`): when the **partner** called trump and
   I do **not** hold the master, still lead a trump to strip opponents. The partner is assumed
   to hold the top trumps (J/9) and overtrumps to win. Card chosen, in order:
   **Q, then K, then T, then A** (sacrifice the weakest honor first, keep the stronger ones);
   if no honor, the **lowest trump that is not the 9** (7/8). **Never lead the 9** (a
   near-master kept as a winner, so the partner's Jack is not stripped by our own draw). The
   Jack never appears here (holding it makes the bot the master, handled by step 1).

   Skipped if: the partner is void in trump (no overtrump to set up), a **known** opponent
   holds a trump above the bot's best (the "partner has the top" assumption is disproven), the
   only trump available to lead would be the 9 (then the bot does not draw), or the **opponents
   are already out of trump** (see the note below).

   > **Opponents out of trump -> do not draw, let the partner lead** (`opponentsOutOfTrump`):
   > once **both** opponents are known void in trump (or every trump is otherwise accounted
   > for), the remaining trumps sit only with the bot and its partner. Leading a trump then
   > "draws" nothing — it only strips the partner's own trump control — so both draw steps are
   > skipped and the bot leads a side suit instead (cash a boss, feed a ruff, or lead safe),
   > handing the lead to the partner who holds the trump control. This matters because
   > `trumpsRemainUnseen` cannot tell the **partner's unknown** trumps from an opponent's, so on
   > its own it would still report trumps outstanding and keep the bot drawing at its own partner.
   > Example: the partner leads trump twice, the opponents cannot follow the second time (marking
   > them void), the bot wins with a bigger trump — now on lead, the bot leads a **side suit**,
   > not another trump.

   | Trumps in hand (partner called) | Leads | Why |
   |---|---|---|
   | 9♥ 8♥ | 8♥ | no honor, lead low, keep the 9 |
   | Q♥ K♥ | Q♥ | weakest honor first |
   | T♥ A♥ | T♥ | T before A in the order |
   | 9♥ A♥ | A♥ | A is an honor; the 9 is kept |
   | only 9♥ | does not draw | never lead a lone 9; move to the next step |

3. **Cash a side-suit boss**: a non-trump card no opponent can beat. Prefers the highest-value
   boss (Aces first).

   **Ace + Ten exception**: when the chosen boss is the **Ace** and the bot **also holds that
   suit's Ten**, it cashes the **Ten** first (the lower one) and keeps the Ace. Holding the Ace
   makes the Ten a boss too, so the Ten still wins the trick, and the Ace stays back as the
   suit's guaranteed master. This applies **only** to the Ace + Ten pair — not to other touching
   honors (e.g. holding K + Q, it still cashes the King, the general highest-value rule).
   Example: opponents called, hand A♠ T♠ 7♣ -> lead **T♠**, keep A♠.

4. **Lead into the partner's void** (`leadIntoPartnerVoid`): with no boss to cash, if the
   partner is known void in a side suit (and not known void in trump, so it can still ruff),
   lead the lowest card of that suit so the partner ruffs and wins. With several void suits,
   the cheapest sacrifice is chosen.

5. **Lead safe**: no boss and no ruff to feed -> lead the lowest-value non-trump (a 0-point
   7/8/9 when held). Never burn a trump here.

6. **Only trumps left** -> lead the highest trump **only if it is the master** (a winner worth
   cashing); otherwise lead the **lowest** (weakest) trump. Leading a high non-master trump just
   donates it to whoever holds the master above it, so the stronger trumps are kept back.
   Example: only trumps left, hand 9♥ 8♥ 7♥ with the J♥ still out -> lead **7♥** (9♥ is not the
   master); but hand J♥ 9♥ 7♥ -> lead **J♥** (the master).

Example (step 2): trump ♥, partner called. Hand Q♥ K♥ A♠ 7♣ -> lead **Q♥** (weakest honor),
keep the K; the partner overtrumps with J/9.

Example (step 4): trump ♥, opponent called. Hand 7♦ K♦ 9♣, partner void in ♦ -> lead **7♦**
so the partner ruffs.

### B3. Following a trick (`chooseFollow`)

First it computes who currently wins. Branches:

**My partner currently wins:**

- If the win is **safe** (no opponent can still beat it): **smear** the highest-point card that
  does not overtake the partner (dump an Ace/Ten onto the guaranteed trick — the highest-point
  non-overtaking card already prefers the Ace over the Ten). If every legal card would overtake
  (e.g. a forced over-play), play the **strongest** card, unless it is the boss/master of its
  suit, then play the **second strongest** and keep the boss for later
  (`strongestPreservingBoss`). **Ace + Ten exception**: if that boss is a non-trump **Ace** and
  the bot **also holds that suit's Ten**, smear the **Ace** instead — spending it surrenders no
  control (the Ten becomes the suit's new boss), so the higher points are banked now onto the
  already-won trick. Example: partner safely won, bot forced over holding A♠ + T♠ -> play **A♠**
  (the Ten stays as the new boss).
- If the win is **not provably safe**, but the partner holds the **boss of a non-trump led
  suit** (only a ruff could beat it) and the one remaining opponent cannot certainly ruff:
  **risk-smear** the high points anyway (`shouldSmearOntoPartnerBoss`). See the rule below.
- Otherwise: keep points home with the lowest value.

- **Risk-smear detail** (`shouldSmearOntoPartnerBoss`): when the partner leads a non-trump
  **Ace** (or the current top of the suit), an opponent follows suit, and the bot sits third
  with one opponent left, the only thing that can beat the partner is a ruff from that last
  opponent. The bot smears its highest points, accepting the **unknown** ruff risk. It keeps
  points home only when that last opponent is **known void** in the led suit **and** could
  still hold a trump (a near-certain ruff). If that opponent is also out of trump (known void
  in trump, or **every trump is already accounted for**, via `opponentMayHoldTrump`), it cannot
  ruff, so the bot still smears. When void in led + void in trump, the smear comes from another
  suit; when void in led + holding trump, the engine forces a ruff (Bitola has no partner
  exemption) and there is nothing to smear.

  | Partner has the boss, bot follows third | Behavior |
  |---|---|
  | last opponent's void unknown | smear high points |
  | last opponent known void in led, could hold trump | keep points home (likely ruff) |
  | last opponent known void in led, but out of trump | smear (cannot ruff) |
  | every trump already played | smear (cannot ruff) |
  | partner winning a non-boss card | keep points home |

**An opponent currently wins:**

- If the partner is yet to play and is **guaranteed** to take the trick (`partnerTakesTrick`):
  smear the highest-point non-overtaking card, else lowest value.
- **Last to play and can win by following the led non-trump suit**: bank the
  **highest-points** led-suit winner instead of the cheapest (`highestPointsLedSuitWinner`).
  Banked into this trick (guaranteed as last player) it is safe; kept and led next trick it
  risks a ruff. Ruff wins (void in led) and trump-led tricks fall through unchanged.
- Otherwise: take the trick **as cheaply as possible** (`cheapestWinning`).
- Cannot win: **discard** the lowest value, preserving trump.

Example (smear): trump ♥, partner led A♥ (safe). Hand ♥T ♥7 ♣K -> play **♥T** (10 points onto
the partner's trick), not ♥7.

Example (preserve boss, 5.1.1): partner wins with Q♠, bot forced over with K♠ and Q♠ (A♠/T♠
gone) -> K♠ is the boss, so play **Q♠** and keep K♠. (With A♠ + T♠ instead, the Ace + Ten
exception applies: play **A♠** and keep T♠ as the new boss.)

Example (risk-smear, Rule 8): partner leads A♠, opponent follows low, bot third with T♠ and a
7♠, last opponent's void unknown -> play **T♠** (smear), not 7♠.

Example (bank highest as last, Rule 6): opponent wins with ♠K, bot is last holding A♠ and T♠ ->
play **A♠** now (banks 11 safely) instead of T♠ (which would later lead into a ruff).

---

## 6. What the bot knows: information model

The bot's intelligence is bounded by the View (`buildBotView`), redacted so the bot only sees
what a human in that seat could:

- **Own hand and legal cards** for this turn.
- **Cards played this hand and inferred voids** (from `Memory`). A player who does not follow
  the led suit is marked void in it (`ObservePlay`). Voids are tracked for **all 4 seats**
  (including the partner, used by the lead-into-void and smear rules).
- **Known cards per seat**: only from the public declaration reveal, and only the winning
  declaration team's cards. This is the only "x-ray" and it is legal information.
- **Scores, hand points, tricks won**: present in the View but currently **not used** by any
  heuristic.

Reasoning helpers (all pure, in `bot.go`):

- `unseenCards`: the full deck minus everything placed (played, own hand, current trick,
  known holdings).
- `threats`: unseen cards **plus** cards a known opponent holds. A partner's known card is
  never a threat. Most heuristics (`holdsMasterTrump`, `isSuitBoss`, `trumpsRemainUnseen`,
  `partnerWinIsSafe`, `shouldSmearOntoPartnerBoss`) scan `threats`, so once the partner has
  declared the high cards they leave the threat set and the bot stops fighting the partner.

---

## 7. Timing and humanization (`bot_driver.go`)

No bearing on which card, only when:

- Game decisions: uniform random delay in `[botDelayMin, botDelayMax]`.
- Score-reveal acknowledgements: a single short beat.
- Generation/context guards ensure the bot never double-acts or acts on a stale decision point.

---

## 8. Tuning levers and blind spots

By impact:

1. `wantsTrump` and `hasSideAce`: bidding aggressiveness (the biggest dial).
2. `trumpSuitScore` + `trumpLengthBonus`: round-2 suit preference (length vs. points).
3. `chooseLead` priority: when to draw trumps (with the master or for the partner, and
   `opponentsOutOfTrump` stops the draw once opponents are void), cash a boss (Ace/Ten handling),
   feed a partner ruff, or lead safe.
4. `chooseFollow`: smear, risk-smear, banking, and point management.
5. `partnerDrawTrump`: the Q/K/T/A order and the "never the 9" rule.
6. `retainLastTrickWinner` + `isUncuttableBoss`: capturing the +10 in the last trick.

Blind spots if you want a stronger bot:

- `TeamScores` / `HandPoints` / `TricksWon` are in the View but **never consulted**: no
  "we are behind, play aggressive" or "the contract is secured, coast" logic.
- No signalling or inference from the **partner's** discards (only voids are used).
- No forced pick in round 2 (weak hands just reshuffle).
- Belote, declarations, and accepting surrender are unconditional (correct, nothing to tune).
